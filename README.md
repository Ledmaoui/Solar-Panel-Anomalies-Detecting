# Solar-Panel-Anomalies-Detecting with CNN

## Overview

This repository contains the data and code, and a Desktop application was implemented using Pyqt5 to detect anomalies in solar panel performance using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The aim of this project is to improve the monitoring and maintenance of solar panel systems by automatically detecting irregularities in energy generation data. This allows for more efficient fault detection and preventive maintenance, helping to ensure optimal solar energy system performance.
