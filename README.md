# Solar-Panel-Anomalies-Detecting with CNN

## Overview

This repository contains the data and code for detecting anomalies in solar panel performance using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The aim of this project is to improve the monitoring and maintenance of solar panel systems by automatically detecting irregularities in energy generation data. This allows for more efficient fault detection and preventive maintenance, helping to ensure optimal performance of solar energy systems
